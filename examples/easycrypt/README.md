# Experiments with EasyCrypt

## Basic Hash protocol modelling and security
The EasyCrypt authentication and unlinkability proofs for the Basic
Hash protocol are in:
- `basic-hash-auth.ec`
- `basic-hash-unkink.ec`

## Other proofs
We also showed the authentication of a simplified Basic Hash protocol,
with only one tag (running multiple sessions) in:
- `others/basic-hash-single-tag.ec`
