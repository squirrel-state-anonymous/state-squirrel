(** This module defines bi-processes and an internal representation that is
  * useful to perform backward reachability analysis on them. It is

  * reachability properties. In particular we do not perform the folding

(** {2 Front-end processes}
  * The computational semantics is action-deterministic
  * (e.g. existential lookup is arbitrarily made deterministic) but in the tool
  * some constructs may be non-deterministic: we are reasoning over unknown
  * determinizations.
  *
  * It may be useful in the future to check for sources of non-determinism
  * other than existential choices. They may be useful, though, e.g. to
  * model mixnets. *)
